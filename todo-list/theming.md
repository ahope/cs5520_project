# Changing the theme/styles, Material-ish

I'm pushing a bit harder to style the UI the way I really want. I'm following along with the 
"Change the app theme" codelab (https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-change-app-theme#2), 
but in Java rather than Kotlin (not sure that it will matter!)
