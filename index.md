This is the website I'll use to make it easy to find code snippets and various resources for class. 

Information about assignments and assignment submission is on Canvas; this is more for examples from class and other interesting things.

# Mobile Design and Development

My goals for this class: 

* **Help you develop as an engineer.** You may or may not continue on as a mobile developer, but in any case, there 
are many ways you can develop as an engineer by learning mobile development. Part of it is pure technical details: becoming 
more comfortable with Github, learning how to use SDKs and frameworks in your projects. 
* **Help you communicate as a student and developer.**
